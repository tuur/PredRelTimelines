Barack Obama would <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e1">make</EVENT> a great stand-up comic, not because he's the funniest president ever but because he uses jokes the same way many of us comedians do: as a weapon.

Traditionally, the (intentionally) funny lines by our presidents have <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e2">had</EVENT> one thing in common: They were self-deprecating. Sure, some presidents have <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e3">used</EVENT> jokes to take jabs at their opponents, but not to the extent of Obama.

During his <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">tenure</TIMEX3>, he has increasingly <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e4">unleashed</EVENT> biting comedic barbs against his critics and political adversaries. These jokes are <EVENT class="I_ACTION" eid="e5">intended</EVENT> to do more than simply entertain you. They have an agenda.

Obama's humor is often delivered the way a comedian dealing with a heckler would do it. He <EVENT class="I_ACTION" eid="e6">tries</EVENT> to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e7">undermine</EVENT> his opponents with it and get the crowd -- in this case the public -- on his side. I can <EVENT class="I_ACTION" eid="e8">assure</EVENT> you that having a crowd laugh at your critic/heckler is not only effective in dominating them, it's also very satisfying.
